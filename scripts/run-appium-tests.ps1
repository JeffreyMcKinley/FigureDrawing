.SYNOPSIS
  Runs the FigureDrawing Appium end-to-end UI tests (FigureDrawing.UITests).

.DESCRIPTION
  These tests need infrastructure that a normal `nx test` deliberately skips. This script wires it
  all up, runs the suite with RUN_APPIUM=1, and tears the server down afterwards:

    1. installs Appium + the uiautomator2 driver if missing (global npm)
    2. boots the FigureDrawing_Pixel emulator if no device is attached
    3. builds + installs the signed APK
    4. starts an Appium server, waits for it, runs the tests, stops the server

  Prereqs (see repo memory): JDK 17 + Android SDK. Override paths with the params below or the
  matching environment variables.

  Two AVDs are in play. FigureDrawing_Pixel (phone) is the default. FigureDrawing_Fold is a
  "7.6in Foldable" (1768x2208 @420dpi = 673dp wide unfolded), which is the geometry the Galaxy Z
  Fold7 rail bug showed up on: the player rail becomes a fixed-width column beside the pose there
  without any rotation. Run it with -Avd FigureDrawing_Fold; -CreateAvd creates whichever AVD was
  named if it does not exist yet.
