//   * the draft (INV-SET-*)  — parsed inputs, the Start gate, the config and the length estimate;
//   * the sequence (INV-SES-*) — pool, passes, shuffle, counts, drawing-time accounting, the break;
//   * the pose clock (INV-CD-*) — remaining time, pause/resume, how it reads on screen;
//   * image resolution (INV-PLY-*) — turning the current image id into something displayable and

//   * the totals (INV-SUM-*) — images displayed, drawing time, average pose.

// Generic over the image type so Bitmap never enters Core (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4). The screen is
// left with a repaint loop, lifecycle calls, and rendering.
