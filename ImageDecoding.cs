    // Shared reference-image decoding used by both the folder preview (MainActivity) and the session
    // player (SessionActivity). Real photos are far larger than the screen, so it down-samples: the
    // first pass reads only the bounds, the second decodes at the computed sample size, keeping a
    // folder of full-resolution images within memory. Returns null when the uri can't be decoded.
    //
    // Two bounds, not one: requestDimension is the quality floor for the short side (a tile is
    // center-cropped, so decoding below it would upscale), maxDimension is the memory ceiling for
    // the long side and holds whatever the aspect ratio is — a 12000x900 panorama is sampled down
    // rather than decoded at full width.
